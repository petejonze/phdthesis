### Project Description
A LaTeX class (.cls) file to format a PhD thesis (NB: this is what it ended up looking like: http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/13376/1/pj_thesis_v2_1_2.pdf).

Formatting your thesis can be a very personal, and very rewarding process. However, if you're looking to save time or get some ideas, here is the LaTeX class that I used to format my thesis. It can be used 'as is' - simply plug in your own content and it will do all the formatting for you. Alternatively, it can be easily modified, extended, or plundered for ideas. If you make any changes/improvements please upload them here (join the group to get upload permissions), or send me a relevant link so I can include a reference.
		
### Quick Start: Setting up
1. Download the Zip archive and unzip it into an appropriate directory
2. Open example_thesis.tex (e.g., in TexMaker)
3. Run, either using LaTeX or PDFLatex (F2 and F6 in TexMaker, respecitvely)
4. View the results!

If you've never used LaTeX then don't fear. Though it can be a daunting prospect for the uninitiated, it is actually surprisingly simple to use, and it is usually possible to get everything up and running within one hour.

### System Requirements
LaTeX2e (released 1994). This is free software is distributed under the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL). The MikTex distribution of LaTeX2e is recommended on Windows. On other operating systems Tex Live is recommended (included as standard part of Mac OS X).

### Known issues
No multi-lingual support at the moment. I played with Babel briefly, but it had a few bugs that needed ironing out.

### Other good LaTeX classes
See www.sharelatex.com

### Acknowledgments
In making this I also spent a while looking around at other theses classes/templates. I found the University of Edinburgh and the University of Cambridge's particularly useful; thanks guys. This class is in many respects an amalgamation of packages (around 40 or so). Please see the main .cls file for a complete listing.

### FAQ
**Q**I've only ever used Word. Will this take me a long time to learn?   
**A** Probably no longer than you will spend trying to format in Word.

**Q** How do I install LaTeX?   
**A** On windows you will need to install the basic engine (e.g., MikTex), and an editor (e.g., Texmaker). For more info, see: http://www.howtotex.com/howto/installing-latex-on-windows

**Q** I've noticed a bug in file x, what should I do?   
**A** E-mail me (petejonze AT gmail) and let me know. Better yet, fix it and send me a copy. Or sign up to Git to get direct access to the primary source code.

### Enjoy!
